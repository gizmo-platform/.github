# Welcome!

You've found the organizational presence behind all the software of
the Gizmo platform which includes hardware, software, and support
libraries to build robots, unique automations, and other exciting
widgets that will help you understand STEM concepts.

If you're and end-user of our platform, you probably want to start
with [our documentation](https://gizmo-platform.github.io).  Even if
you're planning to contribute to our codebase, we still recommend
starting with the documentation to get a good understanding of our
hardware and software architectures.

If you're here to ask a question, show off something cool you've
built, or ask others for help, you'll want to start in our
[forum](https://github.com/orgs/gizmo-platform/discussions).

If you want to work on tools that users consume to manage the
platform, you'll want to work in the main [gizmo
repo](https://github.com/gizmo-platform/gizmo).

Want to get your hands dirty with low level systems development work?
That's great, you're looking for either our
[firmware](https://github.com/gizmo-platform/firmware), or our
[hardware](https://github.com/gizmo-platform/hardware).

For everything else, peruse the libraries tab at the top of this page,
and if there's anything that isn't easily found, please let us know!
